<h1>Check for Non-Identical String Rotation</h1>

<h2>Problem made by https://www.hackerrank.com/:</h2>


Given two strings s1 and s2, return 1 if s2 is a rotation of s1 but not identical to s1, otherwise return 0.

Example

Input:

s1 = abcde
s2 = cdeab
Output:

True
Explanation:

- s2 ('cdeab') is a non-trivial rotation of s1 ('abcde'). 
- If you rotate 'abcde' left by 2 positions, you get 'cdeab'. 
- Since s2 is not equal to s1 and is a rotation, the output is true.
Input Format

The first line contains the string s1, followed by s2 on the next line.
Constraints

1 <= |s1| <= 1000
1 <= |s2| <= 1000
|s1| = |s2|
s1 & s2 both consists of lowercase English letters ('a'-'z') only
Output Format

The function returns a single BOOLEAN value, 1 for True and 0 for False
Sample Input 0

Sample Output 0

Sample Input 1
